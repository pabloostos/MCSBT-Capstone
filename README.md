This Capstone Project is an individual practice that allows students to apply the technical contents learnt over the term, integrating them to solve a real business challenge. The project will consist of the development of a data application deployed in a public cloud infrastructure that is accessible to real users to see and evaluate the result. The final project will be saved in the student's GitHub profile.

The architecture components that will be used are representative of most existing applications and webs, making it possible to extrapolate them to fit with a vast majority of needs. The components include:

- Frontend: This includes the web page and design of the user interface that will be used to interact with the data.
- Backend: This includes the specific logic of the service provided by the site, as well as any algorithms that will be implemented to serve in the frontend.
- Database: This is used to store the relevant information.
- Code Repository: The project code will be stored in a public repository on GitHub.
- API: An API will be created to access the data via other programs.

The project also allows for various flavors and variations from both a functional and technical point of view.
This project also puts the student in the shoes of a software engineer working on a development project for a customer where they will have to make the technical and technology decisions on how to solve the challenge.
